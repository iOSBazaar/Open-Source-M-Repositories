# Mojo Repositories
## Implement Mojo repos directly into your webapp.

#### Overview
The Mojo Dev Team is proud to present open-source Mojo repositories, directly implementable 
into any webapp you choose. We've (hopefully) made it as easy as possible to implement
the repos without almost no coding knowledge needed.

#### Installation
Installation of Mojo repositories is super simple. It is all based in one folder and is all
handled by javascript. To install Mojo repositories, upload the `repositories` folder to the
root of your application. Next, add `<script src="repositories/functions.js"></script>` to
your application code wherever you are adding your javascript files. Lastly, just like
linking to a regular page, you need to create a page link to `repositories/packages.html`.
Everything else is handled by M-Repos.
